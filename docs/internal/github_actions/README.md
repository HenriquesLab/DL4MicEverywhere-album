# GitHub actions

GitHub actions are stored on [`.github/workflow`](../../../.github/workflows) folder and they can be divided in two sections:

1. [Deployment of album's solutions.](deploy_solution.md)
2. [Deployment of the webpage.](deploy_webpage.md)

Click on the links for further information about when are they triggered and how do they work.
