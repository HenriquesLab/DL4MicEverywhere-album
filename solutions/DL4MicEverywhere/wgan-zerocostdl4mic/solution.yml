description: Super-resolution via super-pixelisation. Wasserstein GAN (DFCAN) is a
  network created to transform low-resolution (LR) images to super-resolved (SR) images,
  published by Gulrajani I. et al. arXiv 2017. The training is done using LR-SR image
  pairs, taking the LR images as input and obtaining an output as close to SR as posible.
