description: self-supervised denoising of 3D images. Noise2VOID 3D is deep-learning
  method that can be used to denoise 3D microscopy images. By running this notebook,
  you can train your own network and denoise your images. Note - visit the ZeroCostDL4Mic
  wiki to check the original publications this network is based on and make sure you
  cite these.
