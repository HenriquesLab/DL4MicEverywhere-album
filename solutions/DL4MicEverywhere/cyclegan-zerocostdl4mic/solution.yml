description: Unpaired image-to-image translation of 2D images. CycleGAN is a method
  that can capture the characteristics of one image domain and figure out how these
  characteristics could be translated into another image domain, all in the absence
  of any paired training examples (ie transform a horse into zebra or apples into
  oranges). While CycleGAN can potentially be used for any type of image-to-image
  translation, we illustrate that it can be used to predict what a fluorescent label
  would look like when imaged using another imaging modalities. Note - visit the ZeroCostDL4Mic
  wiki to check the original publications this network is based on and make sure you
  cite these.
