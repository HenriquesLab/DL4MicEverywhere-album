description: Paired image-to-image translation of 2D images. pix2pix is a deep-learning
  method that can be used to translate one type of images into another. While pix2pix
  can potentially be used for any type of image-to-image translation, we demonstrate
  that it can be used to predict a fluorescent image from another fluorescent image.
  Note - visit the ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki to check the original publications this network
  is based on and make sure you cite these.
