description: 2D instance segmentation of oval objects (ie nuclei). StarDist is a deep-learning
  method that can be used to segment cell nuclei in 2D (xy) single images or in stacks
  (xyz). Note - visit the ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki to check the original publications this
  network is based on and make sure you cite these.
