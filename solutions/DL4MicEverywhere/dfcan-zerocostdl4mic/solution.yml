description: Super-resolution via super-pixelisation. Deep Fourier channel attention
  network (DFCAN) is a network created to transform low-resolution (LR) images to
  super-resolved (SR) images, published by Qiao, Chang and Li, Di and Guo, Yuting
  and Liu, Chong and Jiang, Tao and Dai, Qionghai and Li, Dong. The training is done
  using LR-SR image pairs, taking the LR images as input and obtaining an output as
  close to SR as posible.
