description: Supervised restoration of 3D images. RCAN is a neural network capable
  of image restoration from corrupted bio-images. The network allows image denoising
  and resolution improvement in 3D images, in a supervised training manner. The function
  of the network is essentially determined by the set of images provided in the training
  dataset. For instance, if noisy images are provided as input and high signal-to-noise
  ratio images are provided as targets, the network will perform denoising. Note -
  visit the ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki to check the original publications this network is
  based on and make sure you cite these.
