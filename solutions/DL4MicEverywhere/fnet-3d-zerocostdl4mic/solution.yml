description: Paired image-to-image translation of 3D images. Label-free Prediction
  (fnet) is a neural network used to infer the features of cellular structures from
  brightfield or EM images without coloured labels. The network is trained using paired
  training images from the same field of view, imaged in a label-free (e.g. brightfield)
  and labelled condition (e.g. fluorescent protein). When trained, this allows the
  user to identify certain structures from brightfield images alone. The performance
  of fnet may depend significantly on the structure at hand. Note - visit the ZeroCostDL4Mic
  wiki to check the original publications this network is based on and make sure you
  cite these.
