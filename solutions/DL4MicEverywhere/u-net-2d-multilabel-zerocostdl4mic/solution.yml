description: 2D semantic segmentation. U-Net is an encoder-decoder architecture originally
  used for image segmentation. The first half of the U-Net architecture is a downsampling
  convolutional neural network which acts as a feature extractor from input images.
  The other half upsamples these results and restores an image by combining results
  from downsampling with the upsampled images. Note - visit the ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki
  to check the original publications this network is based on and make sure you cite
  these.
