description: Supervised restoration of 3D images. CARE is a neural network capable
  of image restoration from corrupted bio-images, first published in 2018 by Weigert
  et al. in Nature Methods. The network allows image denoising and resolution improvement
  in 2D and 3D images, in a supervised training manner. The function of the network
  is essentially determined by the set of images provided in the training dataset.
  For instance, if noisy images are provided as input and high signal-to-noise ratio
  images are provided as targets, the network will perform denoising. Note - visit
  the ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki to check the original publications this network is based
  on and make sure you cite these.
