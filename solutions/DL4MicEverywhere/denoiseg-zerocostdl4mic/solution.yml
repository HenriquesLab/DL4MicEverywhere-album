description: Joint denoising and binary segmentation of 2D images. DenoiSeg 2D is
  deep-learning method that can be used to jointly denoise and segment 2D microscopy
  images. The benefits of using DenoiSeg (compared to other Deep Learning-based segmentation
  methods) are more prononced when only a few annotated images are available. However,
  the denoising part requires many images to perform well. All the noisy images don't
  need to be labeled to train DenoiSeg. Note - visit the ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki to check
  the original publications this network is based on and make sure you cite these.
