description: "3D binary segmentation. The 3D U-Net was first introduced by \xC7i\xE7\
  ek et al for learning dense volumetric segmentations from sparsely annotated ground-truth\
  \ data building upon the original U-Net architecture by Ronneberger et al. Note\
  \ - visit the ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki to check the original publications this network\
  \ is based on and make sure you cite these."
